    George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? Yeah. Jennifer. Okay Doc, this is it. Mom, Dad.

    Okay, but I don't know what to say. Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. Without any sugar. That's right, he's gonna be mayor.</p>

    <p>Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him. Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you. My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines. Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name. George, help me, please.
